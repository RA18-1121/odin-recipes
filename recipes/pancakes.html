        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A pancake, also known as hotcake, griddlecake, or flapjack, is a flat cake, often thin and round, prepared from a starch-based batter that may contain 
           eggs, milk, and butter, and then cooked on a hot surface such as a griddle or frying pan. It is a type of batter bread.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Flour</li>
            <li>Baking powder</li>
            <li>Sugar</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Milk and butter</li>
            <li>Egg</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Sift flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt together in a large bowl. Make a well in the center and add milk, melted butter, and egg; mix until 
                smooth.</li>
            <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake; 
                cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, about 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
